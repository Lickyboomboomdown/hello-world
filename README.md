Hello world, 
ive been sent here by a weirdo claiming to be myself only 47 years older.
He claims to have made a "far journey" to warn me about a 401k account.
he sounds like my parents telling me to get an education, stop partying.
he gave me an old password to an expired lynda account.
this nut job offered me to pay me the amount that was left in that 401k account
just for completing a JS essentials course.
AnyHoo... 
 Thats why im here the course instructor sold me on this editor called Atom and yadda yadda yadda.
Funny thing, since starting this course i have not seen that crazy ol bastard around
but, i like learning these new skills it might be beneficial to me down the road.
